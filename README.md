# Brains-And-Balls
Zombie Sport TD Game

Made by Isaac Koenders, Aiden Smith, Ben Sherlock, and Tyler Banyas.

To play, pray to god to send a solar flare to flip a bit on your CPU to magically spawn a tower, and hope for the same thing to happen again when the projectiles are fired and that they kill an enemy.
